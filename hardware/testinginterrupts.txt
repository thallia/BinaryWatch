changed hardware pin OE (PD2) to digital pin 0

changed hardware pin ST_CP (PD3) to digital pin 1

changed code pin OE to 0

changed code pin ST_CP to 1

changed code pin inHour to 2

changed code pin inMinute to 3

changed code pin inDisplay to null

addedInterrupt(inHour)
addedInterrupt(inMinute)

add interrupt TIME

TIME has 2 buttons attached: one on it, and one on another pin.
the interrupt will trigger a response that will check the OTHER pin AND the interrupt pin

...that doesn't work.

just connect inHour and inMinute to be button triggers, and in the "wakeup check" function check which one triggered it

Attached interrupt to inTime(2), connected inHour and inMinute, so when I press either of the buttons, it should trigger another check function to see what pin was actually triggered.
