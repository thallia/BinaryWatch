I am about ready to throw fuse bytes at the wall, go buy a gun, put the microcontroller in an interrogation room, and then shoot it if it doesn't work.

....anyway.

Last night I messed around with optiLoader and avrdude, but I got tons of errors with both. I'm gonna start from the beginning, building the circuit over and
re-going through the errors.

lesdodis.

I set up the circuit according to the diagram on my blog: http://thalliatree.net/posts/prepping-the-atmega-hardware-test-bw.html
Just adding the external 16MHz clock, because the ATmega328p doesn't work without
it.

I'm using the Arduino UNO to serially program the fuse bytes.

I ran:

avrdude -c arduino -p m328p -P /dev/ttyACM0 -v -U lfuse:r:h

which outputted this:

avrdude done.  Thank you.

Alright, so looks like 0x0f vs 0x14 is messing up the reading of the device...
which is strange. Hm.

One answer from researching suggested to changed the baud rate.

"The thing that determines which you "talk to" is the baud rate. I believe that when you attempt to use ArduinoISP you need "-b 19200" in your avrdude command so it won't interact with the bootloader (Optiboot uses 115200 I think)."

I added "-b 19200" into my avrdude command, which produced the error:

avrdude: ser_open(): can't set attributes for device "/dev/ttyS0": Inappropriate ioctl for device

...um wat.

Looking further in that same forum, it appears the person having problems stated
that you can't power the chip you're programming with the same Arduino that is
programming it. Going to try an external power source for the chip before
exploring the "inappropriate ioctl" error.

With externally powering the chip, I made some progress! In which this was:

avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 10 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00

Mk then. This person linked to another post which covered that through USB, the
arduino UNO doesn't get enough power to read fuse bytes (very weird bug in the
hardware apparently), so I'm going to try feeding the external GND and VCC into
the arduino UNO as well.

That didn't do anything, same error received.

Doing some more research, this problem could be a multitude of things:

* No communication between the PC and arduino
* ATMega328p UART/bootloader
* something is connected to RX/0 pin

* The AVR has been fused to need a very slow clock
* the AVR has its reset-disable fuse activated in its high fuse byte,
* the AVR has been fused to require an external clock or an external crystal.

I know the cord isn't faulty, I can program other boot-loaded ATmegas with it.
Nothing is connected to the RXD0 pin, so I can rule that out as well.

I know I never fuse-byte programmed it, so the only remaining option could
be the bootloader.

I went about using OptiBoot to burn the bootloader on the ATmega328p, this
could potentially be the problem. I have some empty ATMegas, so I'm going to
attempt burning the regular bootloader on those to see if I can get any different
response.


While getting it set up, I ran into the error of 'missing 'bootloader.tool' configuration parameter.
I found the solution here:
https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-Hardware-Cores-migration-guide-from-1.0-to-1.6

So I need to add the lines:

arduino328bb.bootloader.tool=arduino:avrdude

to boards.txt. After that, Things *started* to run! Almost.
I got the error of an incorrect file path, so it couldn't read the hex file. *hunts down file*
incorrect file path: ~/Downloads/arduino-1.8.5-linux64/arduino-1.8.5/hardware/arduino/avr/bootloaders/ATmegaBOOT_168_atmega328_pro_8MHz.hex

correct file path: ~/Downloads/arduino-1.8.5-linux64/arduino-1.8.5/hardware/arduino/avr/bootloaders/atmega/ATmegaBOOT_168_atmega328_pro_8MHz.hex

Instead of changing the path, I just moved the file to the directory it wanted.

Believe it or not, IT WORKED. WOOO.

Alright, this is *great*. One step closer to figuring this thing out.

With the newly bootloaded ATMega328p, I ran the command again:

avrdude -c arduino -p m328p -P /dev/ttyACM0 -b 19200 -U lfuse:r:-:h

which produced this error:

avrdude: stk500_getparm(): (a) protocol error, expect=0x14, resp=0x14

avrdude: stk500_getparm(): (a) protocol error, expect=0x14, resp=0x01
avrdude: stk500_initialize(): (a) protocol error, expect=0x14, resp=0x10
avrdude: initialization failed, rc=-1
         Double check connections and try again, or use -F to override
         this check.

avrdude: stk500_disable(): unknown response=0x12

;-;

I took out the "-b 19200" flag/value, and ran the command again, which returned:

Oi. what even.
Apparently, people just suggested in this forum post to change the avrdude
configuration to recognize my ATmega's signature XD Seems legit. Lets try it.
(https://www.avrfreaks.net/forum/difference-between-atmega328-328p-and-328pu?skey=expected%20signature%20for%20ATmega328P%20is%201E%2095%2014)

'whereis avrdude' told me that my avrdude configuration file was in /etc/avrdude.conf

So I sudo vimmed into it, and found the ATmega328P entry on line 8681. I changed the signature to be: 0x1e 0x95 0x0f

And that sort of worked!
This was the output of that:

avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e950f (probably m328p)

avrdude: writing output file "<stdout>"
0x0

avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:00, H:00, L:00)

...I'm not entirely sure that the fuses should be '00'. In one forum post, they said part of the issue is avrdude using "safe mode". To disable safe mode, I added a -u to the command:

avrdude -c arduino -p m328p -P /dev/ttyACM0 -v -u -U lfuse:r:-:h

Humm, that didn't seem to do anything. The output file still reads "0x0".
I am not entirely sure this is a huge issue, so I'm going to wrap up for the night, I figured out a *lot* of stuff.

Next steps would likely be to do a little more research on this error, and possibly try writing one of the fuse bytes to see if it works. I'm not seeing a lot of worry about this error, so I may head straight to burning the fuse bytes.

ayyyyyyy

So I found this great site: http://www.martyncurrey.com/arduino-atmega-328p-fuse-settings/

And it makes burning the fuses look really easy....so I'ma try it.

The fuses I need look like this:

L: 0x62
H: 0xD9
E: 0xFF

And he just adds an entry in "boards.txt" to take care of it. *genius*. Lets try this out...

There's my custom entry. Lets run it and see how that does.

The arduino UNO is still connected to my circuit, and still has the bootloader code on it. I got the same error as I did earlier:

Error while burning bootloader: missing 'bootloader.tool' configuration parameter

So I went back into boards.txt and changed this line:

atmega328pbb.upload.using=arduino:avrdude

to:

atmega328pbb.bootloader.tool=arduino:avrdude

restarted the ArduinoIDE, burned, and got this error:

avrdude: can't open input file /home/thallia/Downloads/arduino-1.8.5-linux64/arduino-1.8.5/hardware/arduino/avr/bootloaders/ATmgeaBOOT_168_atmega328_pro_8MHz.hex: No such file or directory

..which I should've fixed that...oh derp. "atmega" not "atmgea". *facepalm*.

:oooo no errors!! woohoo! Okay, so the fuse bytes *should* have been changed with that. Let's see what avrdude did:

avrdude done.  Thank you.



duuuuuude.
how come I didn't know it was this easy before?

lets test out the microcontroller now!

okay so looks like you actually have to have an "upload.tool" line in boards.txt or else it won't let you upload a thing.
After that, it still wouldn't upload, giving me that annoying "programmer is not responding/not in sync" error.

After looking around on Nick Gammon's site, if the "divide by 8" fuse bit is set, you can't upload programs...so now I gotta fix that.

I went and changed the fuse byte from 0xD9 to 0xE2, which changes the CKDIV8 bit. When burning the bootloader though, it has an error.

avrdude: verification error, first mismatch at byte 0x0000
         0xc2 != 0xe2
avrdude: verification error; content mismatch

...hmm. I wonder why it's writing c and not e. Lets try programming it and see what happens.

oh crud. I changed the high fuse not the low fuse. rip rip rip. Back to the boards.txt.....

okay, that fixed it. Phew, I thought I may have bricked it there for a sec. *now* lets try programming it again...

Oops, it looks like it's not actually using the bootloader, so it can't upload the program. That would make sense.

This time I need to change the High Fuse byte to 0xD8 instead of 0xD9.
Testing program uploading again.....
and boom. It worked. :D

turns out none of those were actually the errors lol, the UNO just needed its own atmega328p in it. *derp*

The test circuit worked, and it drew the expected amount of current. WOOOHOOOO.
major progress!

Next steps: test the sleep code with the binary watch code.
