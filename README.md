# BinaryWatch
My first project designing and creating *everything*. 

Current board rev: 3.1
  * atmega328p
  * SN74HC595N x2
  * coin cell battery
  * LEDs x10
  * 16MHz external clock
  * two buttons for configuring time
  * one button for sleep/wakeup
  * jumper wires
  * resistors (10k, 220k)
  * arduino uno (for easier programming in the beginning)

PCB designed on: eagleCAD



CURRENT TASK: The basis code is finished! Onto deep sleep research and finishing up the hardware setup (specifically hooking up the atmega processor by itself).
