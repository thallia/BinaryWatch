# BinaryWatch
My first project designing and creating *everything*. 

Current board rev: *3.1*

  * atmega328p
  * SN74HC595N x2
  * coin cell battery
  * LEDs x10
  * 16MHz external clock
  * 2 22pF capacitors
  * two buttons for configuring time
  * one button for sleep/wakeup
  * jumper wires
  * resistors (1 10K, 10 220K)
  * arduino uno (for easier programming in the beginning)

PCB designed on: eagleCAD



**CURRENT TASK:** Hardware setup complete. Next, research deep sleep modules and implement before mock setup with coin cell battery. Start designing schematic.
