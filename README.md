# BinaryWatch
My first project designing and creating *everything*. 

Current board rev: *4.1*

Supplies I went through for breadboard testing:
  * atmega328p-pu
  * sn74hc595n x2
  * LEDs x10 
  * 16MHz external crystal
  * 32.768kHz external crystal
  * 2 22pF capacitors
  * 2 0.1uF capacitors
  * two buttons for configuring time
  * one button for sleep/wakeup
  * jumper wires
  
  * arduino uno (for easier programming in the beginning)
  
Supplies for PCB:
  * (SMD) atmega328p-au 
  * 74hc595 SMD shift registers x2
  * JST right angle connector
  * 400mAh Li-Po battery
  * LEDs 1206 SMD x10 (or flat top, whatever you prefer.)
  * 32.768kHz SC-32S SMD crystal
  * SMD capacitors 0805 22pF x2
  * SMD capacitors 0805 12.5pF x2
  * 3 buttons
  * 10k SMD resistors 0805 x1
  * 2k SMD resistors 0805 x10 (in testing for LED brightness)
  * PCB (oshpark)
  * 3D printed case (fusion360)

PCB designed on: eagleCAD
3D case designed on: fusion360

**CURRENT TASK:** PCB is complete, the ATmega328P is programmed, need to do some clean up soldering work. Revised 3D printed case and will be printed 5-12-18
