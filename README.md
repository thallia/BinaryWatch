# BinaryWatch
My first project designing and creating *everything*. 

Current board rev: 3.1
  * atmega328p
  * SN74HC595N
  * coin cell battery
  * LEDs
  * two buttons for configuring time
  * one button for sleep/wakeup

Designed on: eagleCAD

the code is based off of Gector's binary clock, for now. Need to fix the `minuteDisplay` function and figure out how to enable deep sleep/low power on the atmega. Then maybe rewrite it all.
