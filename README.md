# BinaryWatch
My first project designing and creating *everything*. 

Current board rev: *3.1*

  * atmega328p-pu
  * sn74hc595n x2
  * coin cell battery
  * LEDs x20 (10 for breadboard, 10 for mock thru-hole)
  * 16MHz external crystal
  * 32.768kHz external crystal
  * 2 22pF capacitors
  * two buttons for configuring time
  * one button for sleep/wakeup
  * jumper wires
  * resistors (1 10K, 10 220, 10 20k)
  * arduino uno (for easier programming in the beginning)

PCB designed on: eagleCAD



**CURRENT TASK:** Test out moving the clock source from external to AS2/Timer2. This way I will be able to enable the sleep modes to reduce power consumption.
